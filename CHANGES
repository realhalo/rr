v1.3
- Fix for when passing a blank value to rr it would incorrectly
  output the first retained value in ~/.rr.
- Fix for overly-generous short-hand/partial matching of retained
  values, which crippled some of rr's functionality.  Now rr strictly
  searches for the whole filename/directory first, then uses the generous
  partial matching as a fallback.
- Minor miscellaneous code clean-up, changes, and error output standardization.
- NOTE: I'm considering this a stable/mature project as it should not need
  changes from here on... unless more bugs are found. :(

v1.2
- Initial release.
- Added file globbing support for execution of retained directories.

v1.1:
- Initial version.
